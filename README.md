# Clustering_economic_indicators
Code is part of GA work. The goal of “Clustering1.ipynb” and “Clustering2.ipynb” was to look at economic indicators to see if there was any patterns or splits in the data that could be helpful for the model we were trying to create. 

 “Clustering1.ipynb” started out with trying to cluster all economic indicators by percent change and then raw numbers. No real patterns or splits in the data were seen. Next, only one indicator “GDP” was clustered and patterns and splits in the data were seen. 

“Clustering2.ipynb” is just clustering other economic indicators by themselves. Examples of indicators were ”Non Farm Payroll” and “university of Michigan Confidence”. Results showed patterns and splits in the data that were useful for the project.
